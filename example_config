# An example Asink configuration file. The `asink' command will search
# for this file at ~/.asink/config. If you want to keep it somewhere
# else, you must run the `asink' command with the `-c' option:
#     asink -c /path/to/your/config
#
# This file must remain only readable and writable only by the user
# running the Asink client (i.e. `chmod 600 config`) because it contains
# passwords and encryption keys.

# The [storage] section controls how/where your files are stored (The

# section varies depending on which storage provider you use.
#
# The current storage options are:
#  local
#  FTP
#  Google Drive
#
# Be sure you only uncomment one of the following "method = ..." lines
# along with its corresponding options.

## Local storage ##
# Local storage is useful if you want to back your files up to a NFS
# share or something you can mount locally (and also for testing Asink
# with only one machine).
method = local

# The directory to store files in
dir = /home/user1/.asink/localstorage


## FTP storage ##
#method = ftp

# The hostname or IP address of the FTP server
#server = localhost

# The remote port the FTP server is using
#port = 21

# The directory on the server you want to store your files in
#directory = asink_ftp

# The username and password used to connect to the FTP server
#username = user1
# Don't surround with quotes unless your password contains them
#password = user1password


## Google Drive storage ##
#method = gdrive

# Where to cache your GDrive auth token
#cachefile = /home/user1/.asink/gdrive_cache.json

# The directory on the server in which you want to store your files (will be
# created if it doesn't exist).
#directory = asink

# The user-specific auth code received when you authorize the Asink client to
# access your GDrive files. If you are initially configuring Asink, un-comment
# this but leave it blank. The first time you run the Asink client, you will be
# instructed to visit a URL to obtain this code. Once you've done this, copy
# and paste it here and re-start the Asink client.

# The [encryption] section controls whether or not files are encrypted,

[encryption]

# 'yes' if encryption is enabled and 'no' otherwise
enabled = yes

# The key only needs to be supplied if encryption is enabled. This key
# must match the key supplied in the config file of every other Asink
# client you wish to sync with this one. The key currently cannot be
# changed once you begin synchronizing files, so choose it carefully. In
# the future, there will most likely be an option to change the
# encryption key, but it will involve downloading, decrypting,
# re-encrypting, and re-uploading all the versions of all your files, so
# it will be a time-intensive operation.

# Note: The key should not be surrounded by quotes
