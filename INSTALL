INSTALL for Asink Project
Copyright (C) 2013 Aaron Lindsay <aaron@aclindsay.com>


Building and Installing
=======================

Arch Linux
----------

If you use Arch Linux, an AUR package exists to install Asink:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go-asink-git/


Other Distributions
-------------------

I have not had the time to create packages for other distributions, so you will
have to download the source and compile it using the standard Go command-line
tools: http://golang.org/cmd/go/.

First, install the non-Go dependencies however you prefer: sqlite3

Next, install (well, really just fetch the source to) Asink and its Go
dependencies:

$ go get -d -u github.com/aclindsa/asink/asink
$ go get -d -u github.com/aclindsa/asink/asinkd

If you get an error with the above, it is likely that your $GOPATH is
misconfigured. See http://golang.org/doc/code.html for more information. Do the
following to build the client and server, respectively:

$ go build -o asink github.com/aclindsa/asink/asink
$ go build -o asinkd github.com/aclindsa/asink/asinkd

You may then install these two binaries however and wherever you wish.

In order to allow socket-based communication with your Asink server, you should
ensure that the /var/run/asink directory exists, is owned by root:root and has
755 permissions. On Arch Linux, this is accomplished by creating a file at
/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/asink.conf with the following contents (your distro may
handle this differently):

--- start /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/asink.conf ---
D /run/asink 0755 root root
--- end /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/asink.conf ---


Configuration
=============

The server essentially has no configuration. This will change somewhat once the
server matures and gains non-SQLite database options, etc.

To configure a client, you must create an Asink client config file. The `asink'
command searches for this file at ~/.asink/config, so it is advised that you
create the .asink directory and copy the example configuration file under it
(renaming it to exactly 'config').  The example config file should be called
example_config in the root directory of the git repository, or possibly at
/etc/asink/example_config.

The example configuration file is fairly well commented to help you configure
your clients.
