INSTALL for Asink Project
Copyright (C) 2013 Aaron Lindsay <aaron@aclindsay.com>


Building and Installing
=======================

Arch Linux
----------

If you use Arch Linux, a package exists to install Asink:
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go-asink-git/


Other Distributions
-------------------

I have not had the time to create packages for other distributions, so you will
have to download the source and compile it using the Go command-line tools:
http://golang.org/cmd/go/


Configuration
=============

The server essentially has no configuration. This will change somewhat once the
server matures and gains non-SQLite database options, etc.

To configure a client, you must create an Asink client config file. The `asink'
command searches for this file at ~/.asink/config, so it is advised that you
create the .asink directory and copy the example configuration file under it
(renaming it to exactly 'config').  The example config file should be called
example_config in the root directory of the git repository, or possibly at
/etc/asink/example_config.

The example configuration file is fairly well commented to help you configure
your clients.
